# Project Name: Toxic Comment Classification Challenge

## Overview:
This project aims to address the Toxic Comment Classification Challenge, a prominent Kaggle competition that has been held annually since 2018. The challenge revolves around detecting and categorizing various levels of toxicity in negative and disrespectful online comments, spanning from insults to violent threats. In this project, we explore different text preprocessing techniques, including TF-IDF vectorization and word embedding (specifically GloVe), to enhance the performance of machine learning models for classifying toxic comments.

## Dataset:
The dataset used in this project is sourced from the first edition of the Toxic Comment Classification Challenge. It consists of a collection of online comments labeled with six types of toxicity: toxic, severe toxic, obscene, threat, insult, and identity hate. Detailed information about the dataset and instructions on how to access it can be found [here](link_to_dataset).

## Methodology:
1. **Text Preprocessing:** We experiment with various text preprocessing methods, including TF-IDF vectorization and GloVe word embeddings, to transform the raw text data into numerical representations suitable for machine learning models.
2. **Classifier Evaluation:** We evaluate the performance of three different classifiers: Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Logistic Regression (LR), and Random Forest (RF). Each classifier is trained and tested using the preprocessed text data to classify comments into the six toxicity categories.

## Usage:
To replicate and extend upon our experiments, follow these steps:
1. **Dataset Preparation:** Download the dataset from the provided link and place it in the designated directory.
2. **Text Preprocessing:** Execute the preprocessing script to transform the raw text data into feature vectors using TF-IDF vectorization or GloVe word embeddings.
3. **Classifier Training:** Train the SVC, LR, and RF classifiers using the preprocessed feature vectors.
4. **Evaluation:** Evaluate the performance of each classifier using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Results:
Upon completing the experiments, we will present the results obtained from each classifier, including insights into their performance on the Toxic Comment Classification Challenge dataset. Additionally, we will discuss any observations or conclusions drawn from the experimentation process.

## Future Work:
Potential avenues for future work include:
- Exploring advanced text preprocessing techniques.
- Investigating alternative machine learning algorithms for toxicity classification.
- Scaling the approach to handle larger datasets or real-time inference scenarios.
